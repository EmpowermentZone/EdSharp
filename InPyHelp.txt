InPy 1.1 by Jamal Mazrui

Type a Python statement or expression, followed by Enter.
A trailing semicolon (;) may be used to seperate multiple statements 
on the same line, though indentation would still 
need to be embedded for a nested block.
The prompt changes from a greater than symbbol (>) to a period (.) 
if more input is needed to complete a statement.

If the output of a command is more than 23 lines of text, 
the display is paused so that it does not scroll off the screen.  
The More? prompt then requests a choice, 
to be followed by Enter.  
Enter the letter y or nothing to answer Yes for the next screen.  
Enter n for No, thereby returning to the > input prompt.  
Enter a for All text, which continues without pausing.  
This is useful when logging the output to a file.

Besides regular Python syntax, this interpreter adds some commands.
A command name is lower case, with a space before any argument, 
which is not quoted.

exit or quit - end this program

cls - clear the screen

exec FileName - execute a Python script file

log FileName - log output to a new file

log off - stop logging

help - display this documentation

Other help features of the standard Python interpreter are available, 
e.g., the help() and dir() functions, 
used either with or without parameters.
