Description

EasyEncode is a set of free, open source command-line utilities for detecting and converting file encodings among common formats, operating under Windows.  Each utility operates as a stand-alone executable in console mode, without a graphical user interface (GUI).  Four encodings are supported, accounting for most encodings in use today:  UTF-16, UTF-8 with a byte order mark (BOM), UTF-8 without a BOM, and ANSI.  

Character encodings are a complex subject.  EasyEncode does not eliminate a developer's need for knowledge in this area, but once encodings are understood conceptually, the software eases work with them.  The utilities may be used either manually at the command line, or programmatically by applications that call them as needed.

EasyEncode uses abbreviated names for encodings in lower case without hyphens.  They are further explained as follows:

ansi = an encoding where each of an ordered set of 256 characters is represented by a single byte, having an ordinal value between 0 and 255, inclusive.  The first 128 characters, between 0 and 127, are the standard ASCII character set, consisting of English letters, numbers, punctuation symbols, and control characters.  The 128 characters in the upper half of ansi, between 128 and 255, are other symbols such as the copyright symbol and Greek mathematical symbols.  The upper half of ansi varies depending on the default language of the computer, so is different, for example, in Russian than English.

utf16 = a multibyte encoding for the Unicode character set, which is a standard ordering of over a million characters, representing virtually every natural and specialized language in the world.  The first 128 characters of Unicode are the same as ASCII.  utf16 is an encoding that generally uses two bytes to represent each Unicode character, though more bytes may be used.

utf8b = a different encoding for the same Unicode character set.  The first 128 characters of utf8 are the same single-byte representations as ASCII.  Characters with higher ordinal values require two or three bytes to be encoded.  There are two versions of utf8:  utf8b and utf8n.  A byte order mark (BOM) is a sequence of a few bytes at the beginning of a file which serves as a signature indicating the encoding of characters in the rest of the file.  utf8b uses a BOM, whereas utf8n does not.  Besides an initial BOM, a utf8b and utf8n represent file content identically.

utf8n = UTF8 encoding without a BOM, as explained above.  This has become the default encoding on the Linux and Mac operating systems.  In Windows, there is no single, default encoding.  The console mode environment uses ansi by default;  API and COM calls typically use utf16;  XML and other files often use utf8b.  Since there is no single default, Microsoft recommends the explicit use of a BOM with either utf16 or utf8.  For utf16, a BOM is required, whereas for utf8, it is optional.  Thus utf8 encoding on Windows generally includes a BOM whereas on other platforms, it does not.  Increasingly, software on other platforms ignores a BOM, but some common applications till are confused by a BOM, since these initial bytes of a file do not represent valid Unicode characters, themselves.

Operation

The syntax is the same for the five EasyEncode utilities:  enc.exe, utf16.exe, utf8b.exe, utf8n.exe, and ansi.exe:

util.exe FilePath

where util.exe is one of the above executables and FilePath is a sufficient path and name of the file to process.  Each utility has a single purpose indicated by its file name:

enc.exe = detect and report the encoding of the file.

utf16.exe = convert file to utf16 encoding.  Doing this involves detecting the current encoding first, so that characters are properly recognized before being mapped to a different encoding.  No conversion is attempted if the current encoding fails to be detected, or if it is detected to be the same as the desired encoding.

utf8b.exe = convert file to utf8b encoding.

utf8n.exe = convert file to utf8n encoding.  This might be used, for example, to prepare a file for a cross-platform application that expects utf8n encoding of all input.

ansi.exe = convert file to ansi encoding.  Note that this may lose characters that are not represented in the 256-character set of ansi.  

In addition to the 32-bit executables mentioned above, EasyEncode now includes 64-bit versions with the same file names except for a "64" suffix after the root name of each file, i.e., ansi64.exe, enc64.exe, utf1664.exe, utf8b64.exe, and utf8n64.exe.

In the conversion utilities, the original file is replaced if the desired encoding is different from the current one, which must be detectable.  The automatic detection is extremely accurate, but not perfect.  In rare cases, the actual encoding of a file may not be properly detected.

When a path contains a space character, the path should be enclosed in quotation marks (a standard Windows convention).  

Installation

Unzip the archive at the web address
http://EmpowermentZone.com/EasyEncode.zip

e.g., to the directory
C:\EasyEncode

Then run one of the utilities, passing a file path as a command-line parameter.  If no parameter is passed, a simple help message is displayed.

The utilities may be run from any directory.  To do so without specifying the full path of a utility, add the EasyEncode directory to the Windows search path.

This documentation is also separately available online at

Development Notes

EasyEncode is written in the AutoIT scripting language, available from
http://AutoITScript.com

commented source code is in text files with a .au3 extension.  Batch files are included to recompile the utilities, assuming the default installation of the AutoIT development package.

I welcome feedback, which will help EasyEncode improve over time.  When reporting a problem, please be as specific as possible about Windows version and steps to reproduce the problem.
